# Welcome!

I'm an applied machine learning scientist at Amazon, where I build Bayesian emulators for Amazon's marketplace simulator.
Before Amazon, I worked as an applied scientist at [Secondmind](http://secondmind.ai), specialising on probabilistic models for time series analysis and forecasting.
I received my PhD in Computing from [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing).

I actively do research around Gaussian processes (GPs) with particular focus on fast and efficient approximate inference. I am also interested in state-space models, graph models, stochastic variance estimation (heteroskedasticity) and optimising GPs with natural gradients.

A byproduct of my research is the creation of an internal library for linear time inference in GPs for time series, and, a model-based reinforcement learning investment strategy that runs on a fund.


I'm a senior machine learning researcher at [PROWLER.io](www.prowler.io). I got my PhD in Computing from [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) focusing on Gaussian process models for facial behaviour analysis.
My current research interests are in statistical machine learning, and, in particular, probabilistic models with applications to autonomous decision making and model-based reinforcement learning.
