I'm a machine learning scientist in the quantitative team at BlueCrest capital management. I design systematic strategies based on probabilistic forecasting and generative models.

Before joining BlueCrest, I was an applied machine learning scientist in the supply chain optimisation technology (SCOT) team at Amazon. I built Bayesian emulators of Amazon's marketplace components used in simulating scenarios for inventory planning and control.

Earlier in my carreer, I was exploring the start-up world as an early member of [Secondmind](http://secondmind.ai). I started as a senior machine learning researcher helping to build the research team and the technology of the company and then shifted to an applied scientist role focusing on creating new models for customer products.

Previously I was a research assistant at Imperial College London where I got my PhD in Computing at the [intelligent behaviour understanding group (iBUG)](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Maja Pantic](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/maja/).
Before that I studied in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki where I received my Diploma in Electrical and Computing Engineering.

Between my undergrad and doctoral studies I worked as a research assistant at the [signal processing and biomedical technology unit lab](http://psyche.ee.auth.gr/) with [Prof. Leontios Hadjileontiadis](https://www.ku.ac.ae/academics/college-of-engineering/department/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/people/prof-leontios-hadjileontiadis/).

In the early years, together with [Stamatis Georgoulis](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~georgous/), [Dimitris Tzionas](https://www.dimtzionas.com/) and Kostas Vrenas we took part in Microsoft's Imagine Cup software developement competition and participated in the world finals after receiving the 1st national award for our project *Epione*.
